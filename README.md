# DM-Quantum-Cosmology
Prior work done for the Vision Pro App

These two files are an example of a normal cosmology app, but with the added element of incorporating dark matter. 
As you scroll out you will move from the solar system to the galactic scale, and then finally to a green halo that 
surrounds the Milky Way galaxy. This halo represents the dark matter halos that encompass galaxies. The next phase is 
to better depict such halos and then animate them to show the different features of Space!

This example shows an isolated dark matter halo, but in reality dark matter is a cosmic web known as the "scaffolding of 
the universe." It is one interconnected structure, and the remaining work is to add the filaments that join all the halos 
to each other in a universe spanning network. Manipulating that structure creates all the observable data and facts we see 
when we peer into the universe. 

Additionally, I will adding data cards for all relevant structures in universe, such as the Sun, moon, all the planets in our 
solar system, the nearby galaxies and the Cosmic Microwave Background (seen in the background of this interactive demonstration.)

NASA data will also be incorporated for real time tracking of celestial bodies. In the end Quantum Cosmology will be like 
the Solar System Scope astronomy app, but with the critical addition of dark matter visualizations being merged with the rest of 
the Cosmos.
